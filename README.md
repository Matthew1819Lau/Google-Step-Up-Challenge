# Google-Step-Up-Career-Challenge
The Google Step Up Career Challenge is an online career challenge that helps Google launch a multi-market digital marketing campaign to reach and engage university students about Gemini Pro.
It includes two routes: The Data Science Route and The Data Strategist Route. 

This is a great hands-on experience for me to work as a real data analyst in solving a complicated datasets (Joining tables, VLOOKUP), finding meaningful insights using data analysis techniques such as A/B testing, P-value, Z-test and data preprocessing, and visualising the results in a clear and consice way for people without a data science background. I welcome new challenges in the future to continuously build my career pathway.
